# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS
   In this project you will train a machine to identify your hand gesture and play a rock
paper scissor game against a computer.
# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Rock paper scissors is a hand game in which each player simultaneously forms one of
three moves with an outstretched hand. These moves are ‘rock”, “paper”, and “scissors”
as shown in the image.

Each move wins against one shape and loses to another.

-> Rock ‘crushes’ scissors but is ‘covered’ by paper.

-> Paper ‘covers’ rock but is ‘cut’ by scissors.

-> Scissors is ‘crushed’ by rock but ‘cuts’ paper.
